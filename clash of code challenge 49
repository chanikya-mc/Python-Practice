You are given a base, N, and a solution, Y. You must find the exponent needed to get from the base to the solution (such that N ^ X = Y) and print it.
Input
Line 1: An integer, N, for the base
Line 2: An integer, Y, for the solution
Output
Line 1: An integer for the exponent needed to get from N to Y
Constraints
N > 0
Y > 0
