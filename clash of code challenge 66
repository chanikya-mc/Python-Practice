Change each item in a list L to the number on the index that the number shows.

Example:
if L = 1, 3, 2, 0
then the first number is 1 and the number at the index 1 is 3.
After that, the next number is 3 and at the third index, the number is 0.
If you continue doing that, you will get 3, 0, 2, 1
Input
Line 1: An integer A for the amount of numbers
Line 2: Space separated integers L for the numbers
Output
The number at the index of the list of numbers
Constraints
A = 2^31
All numbers in L are smaller that the length of L
Example
Input
6
3 5 2 5 3 4
Output
5 4 2 4 5 3

coding:
import sys
import math


l=[]
w=[]
a = int(input())
for i in input().split():
    ll = int(i)
    l.append(ll)
for i in range(len(l)):
    w.append(l[l[i]])
print(*w)
