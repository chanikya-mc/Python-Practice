The game mode is REVERSE: You do not have access to the statement. You have to guess what to do by observing the following set of tests:
01 Test 1
Input
Expected output
3
if n == 1:
    print("n is 1")
elif n == 2:
    print("n is 2")
elif n == 3:
    print("n is 3")
else:
    print("number not found :(")
02 Test 2
Input
Expected output
1
if n == 1:
    print("n is 1")
else:
    print("number not found :(")
03 Test 3
Input
Expected output
12
if n == 1:
    print("n is 1")
elif n == 2:
    print("n is 2")
elif n == 3:
    print("n is 3")
elif n == 4:
    print("n is 4")
elif n == 5:
    print("n is 5")
elif n == 6:
