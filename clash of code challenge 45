Given two numbers, A and B, return the number of squares between A and B inclusive.

Between A = 1 and B = 9 inclusive are 3 squares: 1, 4, and 9
Between A = 10 and B = 25 inclusive are 2 squares: 16 and 25
Between A = 26 and B = 35 inclusive are 0 squares
Input
Line 1 : the integer A.
Line 2 : the integer B.
Output
Line 1 : the count of squares between and including A and B or 0 if none are present
Constraints
1 <= A <= B <= 10000000
Example
Input
1
9
Output
3

import math
def CountSquares(a, b):
    return (math.floor(math.sqrt(b)) - math.ceil(math.sqrt(a)) + 1)
 
# Driver Code
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
print (int(CountSquares(a, b)))
