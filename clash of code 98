Output all the words that follow what the user says. If there are none, output 'NONE'. What he says either starts with 'start', 'end', 'vowels', or 'consonants'. This word will be command. After that is another number or letters that will be check.
If it command is 'start', you need to check whether the first letter(s) of the word in the dictionary starts with check.
If command is 'end', you need to check whether the last letter(s) of the word in the dictionary starts with the check.
If command is 'vowels', you need to check if there are check vowels in the word. Vowels are a, e, i, o and u.
If command is 'consonants', you need to check if there are check consonants (which are letters that are not vowels) in the word.

Example:
If words_amount is 3 and the words are:
apple
papaya
pineapple
and commands_amount is 2 and they are:
end e
start p
Then you need to output pineapple.
Input
Line 1: An integer words_amount for the amount of words in the dictionary.
Next words_amount lines: A string word for one word in the dictionary
Next line: An integer commands_amount for the amount of commands the user will give.
Next commands_amount lines: Two space separated words, command and check, for the command the user will give
Output
All the words that follow all the commands.
Constraints
0 ≤ words_amount ≤ 10
There are no words with uppercase letters
0 ≤ commands_amount ≤ 10
Example
Input
3
apple
papaya
pineapple
2
end e
start p
Output
pineapple
