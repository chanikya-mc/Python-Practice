Travelling through the woods one day you come across a quirky cabin in the forest. Inside is the magician Merlin with his set of magical 3-sided dice. Each side has a different color on it (red, blue, and green).

He hands you n unique and identical dice and says: "If you roll all of these dice one-after-the-other and exactly r of them are red, b of them are blue, and g of them are green, I will grant you one wish of your choice."

How many ways can you successfully roll these dice?
Input
Line 1: An integer n representing the number of dice.
Line 2: Three space-separated integers r, b, and g, representing the number of red, blue, and green dice you need to roll (respectively).
Output
Line 1: An integer representing the number of ways you can successfully roll the dice.
Constraints
2 ≤ n ≤ 12
0 ≤ r,b,g ≤ 12
Example
Input
6
1 2 3
Output
60

coding:
n = int(input())
r, b, g = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

# Write an answer using print
# To debug: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)

print(math.comb(n, r)*math.comb(n-r, b))
