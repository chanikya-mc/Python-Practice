You need to simplify the fraction
The numerator is the top number in a fraction and the denominator is the one bellow the line.

If you don't know how to simplify a fraction, this is how you do it with a example:
If numerator is 4 and denominator is 6 the you can figure out that the greatest common factor between them is 2. With that information, You can figure out that the fraction is (4/2)/(6/2) and you should output 2/3.
Input
Line 1: An integer numerator
Line 2: An integer denominator
Output
The simplified fraction
Constraints
1 ≤ numerator < 9^9
numerator ≤ denominator ≤ 9^9
Example
Input
4
6
Output
2/3



code:
from math import gcd
n,d=int(input()),int(input())
g=gcd(n,d)
print(f'{n//g}/{d//g}')
