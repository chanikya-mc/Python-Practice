You are given a string composed by letters and special characters. You have to return a new string by changing the previous one following rules :
- Each letter is replaced by a v if it's a vowel and by a c if it's a consonant. For the purpose of this clash, a, e, i, o, u and y are vowels and all the other letters are consonants.
- If the original letter in string is in uppercase, change the letter to V or C instead of v or c.
- The other characters stay the same.
