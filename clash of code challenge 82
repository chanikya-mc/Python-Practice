You begin with a number N. You can do one of two operations:

Operation 1: Divide the number N by 2 (Note that if N is odd this would not result in an integer, and it would be impossible to reach 1)

Operation 2: Subtract 1 from N

However, you only can do operation 1, dividing N by 2, a maximum of A times.
You want to reach the number 1 in the minimum operations. Print X, the lowest number of operations it takes.
Input
Line 1: An integer N, the starting number.
Line 2: An integer A, the max times you can divide by 2.
Output
Output X, an integer.
Constraints
0 <= x < N <= 10^9+7
Example
Input
5
0
Output
4

coding:
n=int(input())
a=int(input())
c=0
while n!=1:
    if n%2==0 and a>0:
        n//=2
        c+=1
        a-=1
    else:
        n-=1
        c+=1
print(c)
