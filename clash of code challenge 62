The program:
You must output for each participant in a race the traveled distance (in meters) at a given speed S (centimeters/second) in given amount of time T (minutes).
INPUT:
Line 1: An integer N for the number of participants.
Next N lines: Two space separated integers S and T representing respectively the speed S and the time T.
 
OUTPUT:
N Lines: An Integer representing the distance traveled.
 
CONSTRAINTS:
0 ≤ S ≤ 150
0 ≤ T ≤ 100000
 
EXAMPLE:
Input
1

20 10
Output
120
 
 
 coding:
 n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    s, t = [int(j) for j in input().split()]
    t2 = (60*t/100)
    print(int(s*t2))
