Goal
Snakes are happy when they wave their tongue out, ASCII snakes are no exception.

ASCII snakes have ASCII tongues, which appear as "-<" when facing right or ">-" when facing left.
The tongue is always at the (relative) beginning of the snake.
Snakes may have different shapes and lengths.


You need to output the percentage of happy snakes.
Input
Line 1: An integer N for the number of snakes
Next N lines: ASCII snakes
Output

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
Example
Input
1
...__/\_/\_/o-<

code:
n = int(input())
s=0
for i in range(n):

    snake = input()
    if "<" in snake or ">" in snake:
        s=s+1
if s>0:
    print(str(int((s/n)*100))+"%")
else:
    print('0%')
