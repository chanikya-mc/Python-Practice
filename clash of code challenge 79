Given n integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly n-1 of the n integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

example

n = 5

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

You will need the sum of 4 items.

The minimum sum is 1+2+3+4=10 and the maximum sum is 2+3+4+5=14.

The function will print 10 14
Input
Line 1: An integer N for the number of integers to sum.
Next line: Space separated integers arr to sum.
Output
Line 1 : Space separated minimum sum and maximum sum.
Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 100

arr: Space-separated integers -1000 < Each Integer < 100000000
Example
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
Output
10 14


coding:
n = int(input())
arr = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
arr=sorted(arr)
print(sum(arr[:-1]), sum(arr[1:]))
