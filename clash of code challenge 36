By removing the 0 to 405, we get 45, which is equal to 405/9.
We are interested in strictly positive integers, n, less than or equal to N, which, when we remove all their zeros, give n / 9
Input
Line 1: An integer N for the limit number.
Output
Line 1: The bigest integer fulfilling this condition between 0 and N (if there is none, display "none")
Constraints
N â‰¤ 100000
Example
Input
500
Output
405

coding:
for i in range(int(input()),0,-1):
    a=int(str(i).replace("0",""))
    if a==i/9:
        print(i)
        exit()
print("none")
