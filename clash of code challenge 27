You are given three strings chars, s, toGet.
The chars variable has a set of characters. The s variable is a given phrase. The toGet variable has a given character(s). The goal is to output the character in s found at the same index of toGet in chars.

For example:
Let's say the chars variable is "abcdef",
the s is "bed"
and you have toGet the character at index "a".
Then, "a" is the first letter on "abcdef", so the "a" index of "bed" is "b".

Important: There could be more than a character to get, in that case, print each char of each index.
Input
Line 1 : A set of characters chars with all character indexes.
Line 2 : A string s to get character(s).
Line 3: A character(s) toGet that is the index(es) of the string to get.
Output
Line 1 : The characters at the index of toGet in s with the character indexes of chars.
Constraints
length of toGet ≤ length of s ≤ length of chars
Also, there is no same character in chars
Example
Input
abcdefghijklmnopq
Hello, World!
a
Output
H
