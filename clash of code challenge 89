Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle, a, b and c, calculate the perimeter of said triangle if it is a RIGHT triangle (one angle is 90°).

If the three side lengths given are not able to form a RIGHT triangle, print invalid. This could be the case if either
• A length is negative or zero
• The lengths are mismatched. You might test this using the Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²

Hint: You don't really need to google any formulas for this one. Perimeter = a+b+c
Input
Line 1: An integer a containing the length of side a.
Line 2: An integer b containing the length of side b.
Line 3: An integer c containing the length of side c.
Output
Line 1 : The perimeter of the triangle or the string literal invalid.
Constraints
a, b, c are all integers

a + b + c <= 3000
