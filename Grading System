coding:
x=int(input())
if x<=100 and x>=0:
    if x==100:
        print("S")
    elif x>=90 and x<100:
        print("A")
    elif x>=80 and x<90:
        print("B")
    elif x>=70 and x<80:
        print("C")
    elif x>=60 and x<70:
        print("D")
    elif x>=50 and x<60:
        print("E")
    elif x<50:
        print("F")
