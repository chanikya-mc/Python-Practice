You must output the period if every single 1 appears periodically in S or false if not.
Here, just a single 1 exists in a single period if S is periodic.
Input
Line 1: An integer N for the length of S.
Line 2: S consisting of 0 and 1 .
Output
If S is periodic, an integer number representing the period in which 1 appears in S
If S is not periodic, output false
Constraints
0 ≤ N ≤ 500
Example
Input
4
1010
Output
2

coding:
n = int(input())
l = input()
x=l.count("1")
if(n%x==0):
    print(n//x)
else:
    print("false")
