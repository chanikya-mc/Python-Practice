Input consists of 2 integers.
The first integer corresponds to number 1 and the second integer corresponds to number 2.
If it is a Friendly Pair display Friendly Pair or displays Not Friendly Pair.
For example,6 and 28 are Friendly Pair.

(Sum of divisors of 6)/6 = (Sum of divisors of 28)/28.

Sample Input:
6

28

Sample Output:

Friendly Pair

coding:
x=int(input())
y=int(input())
s,s1=0,0
for i in range(1,x):
    if x%i==0:
        s=s+i
for j in range(1,y):
    if y%j==0:
        s1=s1+j
if s/x==s1/y:
    print("Friendly Pair")
else:
    print("Not Friendly Pair")
