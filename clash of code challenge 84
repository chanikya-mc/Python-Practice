The program:
The Syracuse (or Collatz) suite is defined as follows: given an initial integer greater than 0, we apply the following operations while the integer is different that 1:
- it is divided by 2 when even,
- it is multiplied by 3 and raised by 1 when odd.

Your program must display the Syracuse suite of the number N and stop when the value 1 is reached.

INPUT:
Line 1: An integer N that starts the suite.

OUTPUT:
Line 1: The values of the Syracuse suite, separated by a space.

CONSTRAINTS:
1 â‰¤ N < 100

EXAMPLE:
Input
5
Output
5 16 8 4 2 1

coding:
n = int(input())
s=str(n)+" "
i=0
while i<10:
    if n==1:
        break
    elif n%2==0:
        n=n//2
        s=s+str(n)+" "
    else :
        n=(n*3)+1
        s=s+str(n)+" "
        
    i=i+1
print(s.strip())
